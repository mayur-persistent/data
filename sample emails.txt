Hi John, 

This mail is to inform you that I wouldn't be able to do automatic EMI payment $525 for the Loan No: 02882111 for the month of February as the account balance will be  less than the required amount. 

Kindly bear with problem and could you please let me know the future course of action.

Hi John,

I am an account holder in your bank with my saving/ current number 003-117-454646. I had applied for personal loan loan in your esteemed bank. But the loan is not approved for one or another reason. I have fulfilled all conditions as demanded by your bank staff but now they are saying that the loan cannot be approved for the reason (provide the reason of rejection as given by staff).

I request you to consider my application again and guide me that what should I do to get approval.

Thanking you.

Hi John,
 
I would like to make a complaint against your company. The details are set out below.

On 20 November I took out a loan of £100 with you.

You did not check that I could afford to pay back the loan when I took it out. My only income is £56.25 a week from Jobseekers Allowance and I pay £15 a week maintenance for my children. I now find that I am struggling to pay back what I owe.

I had problems paying back my loan because I'm on such a low income. I contacted you to say I was in financial difficulty and offered to repay the loan at a more affordable rate of £5 a week. You did not respond sympathetically and would not accept my offer of repayment.

Taking out the loan means I can't afford to keep up with my maintenance payments and my ex-partner won't let me see the children.

What I would like you to do is to freeze the interest and charges on my loan and accept the repayment offer of £5 a week.

If you fail to resolve my complaint within 8 weeks, or if matters are not settled to my satisfaction, I will have no alternative but to refer my complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service and your trade association.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Martha James
